# Advent of Code 2022

These are my Advent of Code 2022 solutions.

Compared to previous year, I think I have gotten better at *Typing* especially at Generics. Thanks mostly to Python 3.10 and 3.11's effort to make type hints more expresive. My code style have also been influenced by my exposure to *functional programming* and *array programming* paradigms.
